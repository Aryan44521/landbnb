        'The place was awesome..had a peaceful sleep and people were so kind andhelpful. Food(Dinner)was yummy and breakfast was so satisfying with pure cow milk chaiâ€¦I just love chai overthere had two times continuously. Aunty was so cute and Pawan was very helpful and kind boy.100% satisfaction. The only concern was location that was far away to visit white run and other attractive places of Bhuj. Everything was perfect except that. Gonna visit again.',

        'Stayed for a couple of days at this place. Nestled in the midst of nature with birds andflowers all around, its a peaceful place to sit back and relax and maybe have a sip of wine or two A special mention of Mr Rajesh for his constant attention to our needs, local recommendations and his delicious Poha. There are two friendly dogs to keep company; I wish I had more time to spend here',

        'Wonderful location and even more beautiful views from the balcony. The apartment is in one of the prime location and has view to Burj Khalifa from the balcony. The metro station is not walkable but that was not a concern for me as I mostly made use of taxis which are easily available. The communication from the team was enough and on time.',
